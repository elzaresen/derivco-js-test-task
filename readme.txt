JS Test Task for DERIVCO

Time taken: 4 hours

Each reel in the spinbox has two layers of visibility.
First layer is the infinite spin roll animation, and the second one consists of set of spin resulting images: top, middle, bottom, and next.
Next image's purpose is to create reel stopping illusion in animation.
Resulting images appear as reel stops rolling, so html code wise also has a moment of 'surprise'.
